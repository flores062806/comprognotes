Repetitions / Looping

4 Parts of the Loop
1. Initialization
   =>variable=> ctr= i
"i" a common variable that stands for "iterator"
"t" another variable that stands for "row"
and "c" for coloumn 
2. Controlling Condition - is the true/false test that controls the flow of a program.
note : it wont stop if its true
3. Body of Loop
-> Instruction or Statement
4. Update
There are 2 types of update
1. =>inc "increase"
2.=>dec "decrease"

    ctr--
	--ctr
	ctr=ctr-1
	ctr/=3
	Method
	1. Counter-Controlled Loop
	   -> is a loop that repeats a specific number of times.

	2. Event-Controlled Loop
	   -> is a loop that continues running until a specific event happens.
          Unlike a counter-controlled loop, you do NOT know in advance how 
		  many times it will repeat.
		  
Test Loop 
  1. pre-test ==> testing the condition before starting
     ex. : ATM MACHINES - inserting the card before your purpose
  2. post-test ==> quite the opposite of pre-test
   
 
 C Loop Structure
 1. Do while
       syntax: init; (1)
	            body loop; (2) 
				update; (3)
				}while(controlling condtion) (4)
		THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF POST TEST
    
 2. While
       syntax: init; (1)
               while(controllign condition) { (2)
			   body of loop; (3)
			   update; (4)
			   }
         PRE-TEST       			   
	      
 3. For Loop 
        syntax : for(init;controlling condition; update) {
		            body of loop
                }
        PRE-TEST
